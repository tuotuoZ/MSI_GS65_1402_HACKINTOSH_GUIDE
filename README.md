# MSI_GS65_1402_HACKINTOSH_GUIDE
Hi there! I just successfully install the macOS Catalina on my GS65-1402 following [ErrorErrorError's guide](https://github.com/ErrorErrorError/msi-gs65-gs75-hackintosh). That guide is well documentated. Many many thanks to ErrorErrorError. However, the latest model of GS65 has some slight difference than the previous generation. I will make a guide about how to install macOS specificlly on my exact model.
